## What is QEMU?

**QEMU** is a generic and open source machine & userspace _Emulator_ and _Virtualizer_.

**QEMU** is capable of _emulating_ a complete machine in software without any
need for hardware virtualization support. 

By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance. 
**QEMU** can also integrate with the Xen and KVM hypervisors to provide emulated hardware while allowing the
hypervisor to manage the CPU. With hypervisor support, **QEMU** can achieve near native performance for CPUs. 

When **QEMU** emulates CPUs directly it is capable of running operating systems made for one machine (e.g. an ARMv7
board) on a different machine (e.g. an x86_64 PC board).


## Why QEMU?

**QEMU** emulates the machine's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of
different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems.

**QEMU** aims to fit into a variety of use cases. It can be invoked directly
by users wishing to have full control over its behaviour and settings. It also aims to facilitate integration into higher level management layers, by providing a stable command line interface and monitor API.


## Building QEMU

**QEMU** is multi-platform software intended to be buildable on all modern
Linux platforms, OS-X, Win32 (via the Mingw64 toolchain) and a variety
of other UNIX targets. The simple steps to build QEMU are:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
```
